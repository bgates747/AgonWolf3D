;     intended to be displayed on the screen. It allows characters that would 
;     not otherwise normally be sent through to the “printer” to be sent.
;     If the “printer” has not been enabled then this command will just discard 
;     the next byte sent to the VDP.
; inputs: a is the ascii code of the character to send

; VDU 2: Enable “printer” §§
;     Enables the “printer”.
;     In the context of the Agon platform, the “printer” is a serial 
;     terminal that is connected to the VDP’s USB port. Typically 
;     this port is used for power, but it can also be used to send and 
;     receive data to and from the VDP.
;     When the “printer” is enabled, the VDP will send characters it receives 
;     to the “printer” as well as to the screen. It will additionally send 
;     through control codes 8-13. To send other control codes to the “printer”, 
;     use the VDU 1 command.
;     The VDP will not send through other control codes to the printer, 
;     and will will not send through data it receives as part of other commands.

;     This is the default mode for text display.

; VDU 5: Write text at graphics cursor
;     This causes text to be written at the current graphics cursor position.
;     Using this, characters may be positioned at any graphics coordinate within 
;     the graphics viewport. This is useful for positioning text over graphics, 
;     or for positioning text at a specific location on the screen.
;     Characters are plotted using the current graphics foreground colour, 
;     using the current graphics foreground plotting mode (see VDU 18).
;     The character background is transparent, and will not overwrite any 
;     graphics that are already present at the character’s location. 
;     The exception to this is VDU 27, the “delete” character, which backspaces 
;     and deletes as per its usual behaviour, but will erase using the current 
;     graphics background colour.

; VDU 8: Move cursor back one character
;     Moves the text cursor one character in the negative “X” direction. 
;     By default, when at the start of a line it will move to the end of 
;     the previous line (as defined by the current text viewport). 
;     If the cursor is also at the top of the screen then the viewport will scroll down. 
;     The cursor remains constrained to the current text viewport.
;     When in VDU 5 mode and the graphics cursor is active, the viewport will not scroll. 
;     The cursor is just moved left by one character width.
;     Further behaviour of the cursor can be controlled using the VDU 23,16 command.
;     It should be noted that as of Console8 VDP 2.5.0, the cursor system does not 
;     support adjusting the direction of the cursor’s X axis, so this command 
;     will move the cursor to the left. This is likely to change in the future.

; VDU 19, l, p, r, g, b: Define logical colour (COLOUR l, p / COLOUR l, r, g, b)
;     This command sets the colour palette, by mapping a logical colour

;     or for redefining the default colours.
;     If the physical colour number is given as 255 then the colour will 
;     be defined using the red, green, and blue values given. If the physical 
;     colour number is given as any other value then the colour will be defined 
;     using the colour palette entry given by that number, up to colour number 63.
;     If the physical colour is not 255 then the red, green, and blue values 
;     must still be provided, but will be ignored.
;     The values for red, green and blue must be given in the range 0-255. 
;     You should note that the physical Agon hardware only supports 64 colours, 
;     so the actual colour displayed may not be exactly the same as the colour 
;     requested. The nearest colour will be chosen.
